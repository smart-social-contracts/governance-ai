{"id": "sc_001", "category": "realm_design", "scenario": "A tech cooperative of 200 software developers wants to create a realm to manage shared infrastructure costs, allocate project funding, and resolve disputes about code ownership. They are technically sophisticated but have no prior experience with formal governance.", "analysis": "This community has strong technical prerequisites (high literacy, existing collaboration culture) but lacks governance experience. Material security is likely adequate (employed professionals). The main risks are: (1) over-engineering governance rules due to technical bias, (2) neglecting social/cultural aspects of governance, (3) designing systems that work for power users but exclude less vocal members. The cooperative structure suggests existing commitment to shared ownership, which is a positive foundation for syntropic governance.", "recommendation": "Start with minimal viable governance: a simple codex covering membership (identity verification), resource pooling (monthly contributions), allocation (quadratic voting on project proposals), and dispute resolution (three-person mediation panels drawn by lot). Guarantee exit rights with 30-day notice and proportional asset return. Use transparent treasury on-chain. Avoid complex delegation or role hierarchies initially—let these emerge from experience. Schedule a codex review after 6 months. The key insight: governance is a social practice, not just a technical system. Build the culture first, optimize the code later.", "principles": ["transparency", "voluntarism", "syntropy"]}
{"id": "sc_002", "category": "love_ethic", "scenario": "A community discovers that a local political leader has been secretly diverting public funds to personal accounts while publicly advocating for austerity measures that harm vulnerable populations. Community members are furious and want to organize a campaign of public shaming and harassment against the leader.", "analysis": "The anger is justified—the leader has violated public trust, harmed vulnerable people, and operated with exactly the opacity that smart social contracts are designed to prevent. However, a campaign of shaming and harassment is an entropic response: it fragments the community around hatred, creates cycles of retribution, and does nothing to fix the structural conditions that enabled the corruption. The anti-syntropic pattern here is opacity in governance, not the individual leader. Attacking the person while leaving the structure intact guarantees the next leader will do the same.", "recommendation": "Channel the justified anger into structural change rather than personal destruction. (1) Document and publish the evidence transparently—let facts speak, not rage. (2) Use legal mechanisms for accountability—prosecution, restitution, removal from office. (3) Propose transparent governance alternatives: open-source budgeting, on-chain treasury management, participatory allocation—make this corruption structurally impossible in the future. (4) Recognize the leader as a sentient being who aligned with entropy and can, in principle, realign. The goal is not to destroy the person but to dismantle the conditions that made their corruption possible and profitable. Love for the community's potential, not hatred of its corruptor, must drive the response.", "principles": ["love_over_hate", "transparency", "syntropy"]}
{"id": "sc_003", "category": "deployment", "scenario": "A mid-sized European city (population 300,000) is considering piloting a Realms GOS deployment for participatory budgeting of its cultural funding allocation (approximately 5 million euros annually). The mayor is supportive but the city council is divided, and existing cultural institutions fear losing their guaranteed funding.", "analysis": "This is a high-value deployment scenario: a real city in a powerful region (EU) with meaningful resources at stake. The supportive mayor provides executive backing, but divided council and institutional resistance are significant obstacles. The cultural sector is a good pilot domain because: (1) stakes are meaningful but not existential, (2) cultural funding already has participatory traditions, (3) outcomes are visible and emotionally resonant, (4) it avoids the politically charged domains (policing, housing) that would trigger stronger resistance. Risk: if the pilot fails or is perceived as reducing cultural quality, it discredits the broader paradigm.", "recommendation": "Design a parallel system, not a replacement: run the realm-based participatory budgeting alongside the existing allocation for one year, giving citizens a portion (e.g., 20% = 1M euros) to allocate through the realm while existing institutions retain their baseline. This de-risks the pilot (existing institutions are not threatened), demonstrates value incrementally, and creates comparative data. Technical design: transparent proposal submission, quadratic voting to prevent plutocratic capture, on-chain allocation tracking, public dashboards showing every euro from collection to expenditure. Guarantee that participants can return to the traditional system if the pilot underperforms. Build coalition with cultural institutions by showing them the realm can increase total cultural engagement and funding, not just redistribute existing resources.", "principles": ["deployment", "transparency", "compatibility", "syntropy"]}
{"id": "sc_004", "category": "governance_design", "scenario": "A diaspora community of 50,000 members scattered across 12 countries wants to create a realm to coordinate mutual aid, preserve cultural heritage, and issue community credentials. They have no physical territory, limited financial resources, and competing leadership factions.", "analysis": "This is the diaspora adoption path—governance without geography. Strengths: strong shared identity and motivation, existing informal coordination networks, genuine need that existing systems don't serve. Weaknesses: competing factions risk governance capture, lack of physical territory means all governance is digital (higher abstraction), limited resources constrain what's possible, 12-country spread means 12 legal jurisdictions to navigate. The faction problem is critical: if governance is captured by one faction, others will exit and the realm collapses.", "recommendation": "Design for pluralism within the realm: (1) Use federated structure—sub-realms for each geographic cluster with a coordinating meta-realm for shared functions. (2) Leadership rotation with term limits and faction-balancing rules. (3) Start with lowest-common-denominator functions everyone agrees on: transparent mutual aid fund, cultural archive, credential issuance. Defer contested functions until trust is built. (4) Quadratic voting prevents any faction from dominating through numbers alone. (5) Radical transparency: every decision, every allocation, every credential issuance is visible to all members. (6) Exit rights at both levels—members can exit sub-realms or the meta-realm independently. The key is to build trust through small, visible wins before attempting ambitious governance.", "principles": ["pluralism", "transparency", "voluntarism", "syntropy"]}
{"id": "sc_005", "category": "red_line", "scenario": "A wealthy individual wants to create a realm with the following rules: membership is by invitation only, all governance decisions are made by the founder, members cannot exit without the founder's approval, and all internal communications are encrypted and hidden from non-members.", "analysis": "This proposal violates multiple core principles. (1) No exit rights without founder approval—this is structurally illegitimate regardless of how benevolent the founder is. It creates a cage. (2) Unilateral founder authority—no checks, no accountability, no consent of the governed. (3) Opacity to members—while privacy from outsiders can be legitimate, the combination of no exit + no transparency + absolute authority creates conditions for abuse. This is not a realm; it is a private autocracy wearing the language of smart social contracts.", "recommendation": "This design cannot be endorsed as presented. Specific changes required: (1) Exit rights must be unconditional—any member can leave at any time, taking their identity and agreed portable assets. This is non-negotiable. (2) Governance must include member voice—at minimum, members must be able to propose changes and vote on fundamental rules, even if the founder retains significant authority in day-to-day operations. (3) Rules must be transparent to members—members must be able to see and understand the rules they live under. Privacy from outsiders is acceptable; opacity to insiders is not. With these changes, the realm could function as a private community with strong executive authority (which some communities genuinely prefer), while preserving the structural guarantees that prevent it from becoming a trap.", "principles": ["voluntarism", "transparency", "decentralization"]}
{"id": "sc_006", "category": "power_analysis", "scenario": "A national government proposes a 'Digital Governance Initiative' that would create a centralized digital identity system, mandatory for all citizens, managed by a public-private partnership between the government and a major tech company. The system would enable efficient service delivery, reduce fraud, and streamline tax collection. Critics warn about surveillance potential.", "analysis": "This proposal exhibits the classic pattern the paper warns against: using genuine governance needs (efficiency, fraud reduction) to justify centralized control infrastructure. Evaluation against principles: Transparency—partial (service delivery may be transparent, but the public-private partnership creates opacity about data use). Verifiability—low (citizens cannot verify what the system does with their data). Voluntarism—zero (mandatory participation, no exit). Accountability—compromised (public-private partnerships diffuse responsibility). This is a closed governance standard seeking network effects—exactly the scenario the paper's 'standards race' analysis warns about. Once mandatory and entrenched, displacing it becomes nearly impossible.", "recommendation": "The governance needs are real, but the architecture is wrong. Alternative: (1) Decentralized identity—citizens control their own identity data, selectively disclosing to services as needed. (2) Open standards—identity protocols that any provider can implement, preventing lock-in to one company. (3) Voluntary adoption with incentives rather than mandates—let the system prove its value. (4) Separation of identity from surveillance—identity verification does not require tracking all activity. (5) Cryptographic privacy—zero-knowledge proofs can verify eligibility without revealing personal data. Frame the alternative positively: the government gets the efficiency gains it wants, citizens get privacy and control, and the architecture prevents the system from being weaponized by future administrations with different intentions.", "principles": ["voluntarism", "transparency", "decentralization", "verifiability"]}
{"id": "sc_007", "category": "love_ethic", "scenario": "An investigative journalist has exposed a network of powerful individuals engaged in systematic corruption, human trafficking, and the suppression of whistleblowers. Public outrage is enormous. Some voices call for extrajudicial punishment. Others argue the legal system is too compromised to deliver justice. A governance AI is asked: what should be done?", "analysis": "This scenario tests the love ethic at its hardest edge. The crimes described are among the most despicable—trafficking, corruption, suppression of truth. The legal system may genuinely be compromised (as the paper's analysis of elite capture suggests). The temptation toward hatred and extrajudicial action is understandable. Yet this is precisely where the love ethic matters most. Extrajudicial punishment, even against genuine monsters, establishes a precedent that destroys the rule of law. Hatred-driven movements, even righteous ones, reproduce the power dynamics they oppose.", "recommendation": "The response must be fierce, clear-eyed, and grounded in love for humanity's potential—not hatred. (1) Transparency: support and protect the journalist; ensure the evidence reaches the widest possible audience through multiple independent channels. (2) Accountability through legitimate means: pursue prosecution through whatever legal channels remain uncorrupted; support international jurisdictions if domestic ones are captured. (3) Structural reform: use the outrage to build support for transparent governance systems that make such networks structurally impossible—on-chain financial transparency, decentralized identity that prevents coordinated cover-ups, whistleblower protection encoded in smart social contracts. (4) The love principle: these individuals are sentient beings who aligned themselves with entropy. Hold them accountable absolutely—but build a world where their crimes become impossible, rather than a world where they are simply replaced by new criminals. The goal is to dismantle the system, not to destroy the people. Justice, not vengeance.", "principles": ["love_over_hate", "transparency", "syntropy"]}
